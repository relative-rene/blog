#Motivation
This app originated as a weekend project to build a personal api using MongoDB, Express and Node.js.  Once I acquired some Angular skills, I decided to grow my knowledge base by refactoring to a MEAN stack blog.  At the moment, the app has the infrastructure for full CRUD, but I mainly use it to post my trials and tribulations in becoming a self respecting contributing member of the web-uh-sphere.

#What my app needs and getting started
*Dependencies
"bootstrap": "~3.3.6",
"angular": "^1.5.6",
"angular-route"
"body-parser": "^1.15.0",
"express": "^4.13.4",
"mongoose": "^4.4.10",
"ejs": "^2.4.1"
**

1st clone app.... The app should be functional straight out of the box, the "Clone or download" box.
2nd, npm start on the terminal.

#Final thoughts
I bypassed the need for authentication by creating a hidden url where I can contribute my blog post from.  If you are interested in reading my blog please follow the link at the top of the page.
