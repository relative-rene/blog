          It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea and
          not accept it.<br>-Aristotle<br>

            When I first heard of blogs, I thought it was a dairy for the internet
          and okay with idea but it was certainly not for me.  Hindered by insecurity,
          I did not feel my opinions or experiences were worth sharing.  I have always
          admired the written word and I have personally loved and hated a person
          for their expression of it.  Because I have grown from the brave and
          generous people who share their experiences, today, I shed my fears and
          take a step toward contributing to the internet that has taught me so much.
          This will not be a grammatically/politically correct, nor is any effort
          made to be inline with any controversial or accepted school of thought.
          This blog started as a means to catalogue my growth as a Web Developer,
          huMan and SF resident.  I hope you enjoy my perspective or get at least
          get a better understanding on what you donâ€™t like to read. I only garantee
          honesty
