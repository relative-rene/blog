          When I first started programming, I was a Family Case Manager at Glide.
        In retrospect, it was what I had worked toward my whole life.As a child,
        I new I would go to college for a degree, earn some money and help some
        people. Suprisingly, I quickly became disenchanted with the work and my
        favorite past-time became researching things I found interesting and
        seeking out new sources of information. My go to were Tedtalks, Podcasts,
        Coursera and I really enjoyed learning code on codeacademy. I knew
        technolodgy was big business but I never thought I could be apart of it.
        After, a long coversation with a good friend, and tons more research. I
        decided to pursue a career in web developement. In the future, I will be
        a full stack developer. I am excited about the amazing advances that are
        happening in technologdy and biology. I am thrilled to know that I will
        be apart of it. If you'd like to join me on my journey, please feel free
        to contact me.
