                It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea and
                not accept it.<br>-Aristotle<br>

                  When I first heard of blogs, I thought it was a diary for the internet
                and okay with idea but it was certainly not for me.  Hindered by insecurity,
                I did not feel my opinions or experiences were worth sharing.  I have always
                admired the written word and I have personally loved and hated a person
                for their expression of it.  Because I have grown from the brave and
                generous people who share their experiences, today, I shed my fears and
                take a step toward contributing to the internet that has taught me so much.
                This will not be a grammatically/politically correct, nor is any effort
                made to be inline with any controversial or accepted school of thought.
                This blog started as a means to catalogue my growth as a Web Developer,
                huMan and SF resident.  I hope you enjoy my perspective or get at least
                get a better understanding on what you donâ€™t like to read. I only garantee
                honesty
